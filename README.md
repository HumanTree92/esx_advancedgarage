# KNOWN BUGS:
* There is a Limit on how many Vehicles that can be in each garage. For me it was 36 Vehicles in the Car Garage but after that i couldn't pull anymore out. You can still buy more Boats & Planes if the Car Garage is at 36.
* It is Possible to Duplicate Vehicles if the resource is restarted while vehicles are out.
* Might not work well when using the Car Dealer Job. (Haven't Tested this)
