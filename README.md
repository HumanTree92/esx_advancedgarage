3) Place `esx_advancedgarage` in your ESX Directory
4) Add `start esx_advancedgarage` to your server.cfg
5) Add `setr esx_MenuAlign "top-right"` to your server.cfg

# KNOWN BUGS:
* With the New Menu Design there is still a Limit before the Menu breaks. This is something i can't fix. But each Class can holdup to roughly 36 Vehicles for a total of 432 Vehicles.
* It is Possible to Duplicate Vehicles if the resource is restarted while vehicles are out.
